Difference between preg_match and preg_match_all
preg_match stops looking after the first match. preg_match_all, on the other hand, continues to look until it finishes processing the entire string. Once match is found, it uses the remainder of the string to try and apply another match

To perform insensitive search exact match
preg_match("/\b$searchword\b/i", $match_field, $matches);
to perform match exact word
  preg_match("/\b$searchword\b/", $match_field, $matches);
    
  if(empty($matches))
  {
  }
  
  
  
  
  Replace
        $replace_result = preg_replace("/\b$searchword\b/i", $replaceword, $meta_list);
